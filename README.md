# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The goal is to create a predictive model that can assist in estimating house prices using key features.

### Features :-

The features of a house prediction model using linear regression typically involve the input variables or factors that are considered in predicting the target variable, which, in this case, is the house price. Here are common features used in a house price prediction model using linear regression:

1. ***Square Footage (Size of the House)***:
   - The total square footage of the house is a crucial feature. Larger houses tend to have higher prices.

2. ***Number of Bedrooms***:
   - The number of bedrooms in a house is an important factor. Generally, houses with more bedrooms have higher prices.

3. ***Number of Bathrooms***:
   - The number of bathrooms is another significant factor. Houses with more bathrooms may be considered more luxurious and, therefore, might have higher prices.

4. ***Location (Geographical Features)***:
   - The location of the house can significantly impact its price. Factors like neighborhood, proximity to amenities, and the overall desirability of the area are considered.

5. ***Year of Construction or Renovation***:
   - The age or recent renovation of a house can influence its price. Newer or recently renovated houses may have higher values.

6. ***Amenities and Features***:
   - Special features such as a swimming pool, a fireplace, a garage, or high-end appliances can influence the house price.

7. ***Lot Size***:
   - The size of the lot or land associated with the house can contribute to its value.

8. ***Accessibility to Transportation***:
   - Proximity to public transportation or major roads can impact the price, especially in urban areas.

When implementing a linear regression model for house price prediction, it's essential to carefully select features based on their relevance and significance. Additionally, feature engineering techniques may be applied to enhance the model's predictive power. Regularization techniques can also be used to avoid overfitting when dealing with a large number of features.

### Dataset :-
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Median House Prices for California Districts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) derived from the 1990 census.
This is the dataset used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. It serves as an excellent introduction to implementing machine learning algorithms because it requires rudimentary data cleaning, has an easily understandable list of variables and sits at an optimal size between being to toyish and too cumbersome.
Be warned the data aren't cleaned so there are some preprocessing steps required! The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanitory:

- longitude
- latitude
- housing_median_age
- total_rooms
- total_bedrooms
- population
- households
- median_income
- median_house_value
- ocean_proximity

### Model Training :-
The linear regression model is trained using the scikit-learn library. The training script `train_model.py` preprocesses the dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and then trains the model on the features.

### Usage :-
House prediction using linear regression is a common application in the field of machine learning and data analysis. Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (such as house price) and one or more independent variables (features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.). Here are some key reasons why house prediction by linear regression is important:

1. ***Real Estate Valuation***: Linear regression can help in estimating the value of a house based on various features. Real estate professionals, homeowners, and potential buyers can use these predictions to make informed decisions about buying or selling properties.

2. ***Investment Decision-Making***: Investors in real estate use house prediction models to assess potential returns on investment. By analyzing historical data and relevant features, linear regression can provide insights into the potential appreciation or depreciation of property values.

3. ***Market Trends and Analysis***: Linear regression models can be used to analyze market trends. By examining the relationship between housing prices and various factors, analysts and policymakers can gain insights into the health of the real estate market and identify patterns or anomalies.

4. ***Risk Assessment***: Lenders and financial institutions use linear regression to assess the risk associated with mortgage lending. Predictive models help in evaluating the likelihood of default based on factors such as the borrower's credit history, income, and property value.

5. ***Property Appraisal***: Linear regression can assist appraisers in determining the fair market value of a property. This is essential for tax assessments, insurance coverage, and other financial considerations.

6. ***Personal Budgeting***: For individuals looking to buy or sell a house, linear regression models can provide a realistic estimate of the property's value. This information is valuable for budgeting and financial planning.

7. ***Improving Property Features***: By understanding the impact of different features on the house price, homeowners and property developers can make informed decisions about renovations and improvements that are likely to increase the property's value.

8. ***Data-Driven Decision-Making***: Linear regression provides a systematic and data-driven approach to decision-making in the real estate industry. This can lead to more objective and accurate predictions compared to relying solely on intuition or experience.

In summary, house prediction using linear regression is crucial for various stakeholders in the real estate industry, providing them with valuable insights for decision-making, risk assessment, and market analysis.
Also, it is a fundamental model for house prediction utilizing linear regression that may benefit from refinements and enhanced accuracy.
